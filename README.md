[![Code Issues](https://www.quantifiedcode.com/api/v1/project/2f013c5d24d946b5b1344781d982d371/badge.svg)](https://www.quantifiedcode.com/app/project/2f013c5d24d946b5b1344781d982d371)

A template for quickly building [TCEX Apps](https://github.com/ThreatConnect-Inc/tcex) using [cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter).

## Usage

This package is designed to be used with [cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter). Installing cookiecutter can be as easy as:

`pip install cookiecutter`

but there are other options as well (see the [cookiecutter documentation](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html#install-cookiecutter)).

Once cookiecutter is installed, simply run the following command which will prompt you for some values (which it will use to fill out the template) and create a new, ready-to-go directory for your TCEX App in the current working directory.

```shell
# This will ask you to give some input values and will then create a basic
# package for you based on those values in the current directory.
$ cookiecutter https://github.com/fhightower/tcex-app-template.git
```
